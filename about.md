<p>I'm a Systems Development Engineer (a.k.a. SysDE) at Amazon Web Services based in
Dublin, Ireland. What is a SysDE? It's a relatively new role at Amazon. Generally
speaking, it's someone between a System Engineer (SE) and a Software Development
Engineer (SDE). A SysDE should be a proficient coder and have more software engineering
skills than what's expected for a SE; he is not required to have the same level of CS
 fundamentals that a SDE, but in the other hand he should have a deep knowledge of Linux
 or Networking.</p>

<p>I started with computers around 1994, when I was 10 years old. My father won a 286
IBM PC from his job and I was marveled at that green screen and the Microsoft DOS prompt.

From that time until 1999, I was a Microsoft guy, but since 2000, when I started to
use Slackware Linux, I became a Linux enthusiast. The rest is a long story.</p>
