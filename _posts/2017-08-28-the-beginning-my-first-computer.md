![286 IBM PC]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2017-08-28-the-beginning/286_01.jpg)

In 1994, when I was almost 11 years old, my father won a 286 IBM PC from his job. He took the computer home and I started my first steps with it. I was amazed. I knew nothing about computers, nor about English language. In the beginning, I messed up the DOS operating system because, thinking that I was doing a good cleaning, I deleted files that did not execute, like `msdos.sys`, for example - poor boy and father. I remember my father calling to his friend, to learn how to recover the DOS because of my pranks.

But my father was patient and left me continue to use our computer. Soon after, I was reading and trying to understand the content of batch files like `autoexec.bat`. One day, my father turned on the computer and instead of appear the DOS prompt, a menu that I built appeared to him - he never needed the DOS prompt. That was my definitive entry into coding, when I was a child.

Many years after, my father turned on the same computer and I took some pictures. It still works! Thank you, father!
