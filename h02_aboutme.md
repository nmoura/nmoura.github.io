I'm an analyst at ANBIMA, which has an agreement with Brazil's Central Bank for decades to support a special system of settlement and custody called [SELIC](http://www.bcb.gov.br/htms/selic/selicintro.asp?idpai=SELIC). SELIC is actually a department, where I work, fundamental for Brazil economy. Some SELIC roles are the public papers custody and government bonds auctions, which defines base rate.

I enjoy a lot of things, but one of my main interests is computer stuff. I started with computers around 1994, with 10 years old. My father won a 286 IBM PC from his job and I marveled at that green screen and DOS prompt. You can read a bit about this story [here]({% post_url 2017-08-28-the-beginning-my-first-computer %}). From that time until 1999, I was a Microsoft guy, but since 2000, when I started to use Slackware Linux, I became a Linux guy. The rest is a long story.

I also teach as volunteer, at Igreja Batista Betel de Mesquita in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).
