### Distraction

> "Of course it is true that there is much in the world today that distracts and troubles us. Our lives are full of leftovers, we battle through lies and distraction, and nothing resolves. The right response however, is not to endorse this alienation - it is to look back to the path from the desert; one that will point us to a place where the real and the ideal may still exist in harmony."

<p style="text-align: right;">SCRUTON, Roger, in "Why beauty matters?" documentary.</p>
